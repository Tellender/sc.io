# Intro
Paired recording datasets are conceptually very simple but can be used to tackle and explore a variety of interesting questions. Here we propose and describe a list of analysis projects to be carried out on our two paired recording datasets (Marques-Smith et al., 2018; Neto et al., 2016). The Kampff lab will be actively contributing to these projects and they are open to anyone who's interested in taking part. We are crowdsourcing these projects because they are interesting but complex and time-consuming; we simply do not have the full range of expertise and man-power required to complete them in a useful time-frame. That's where **you** come in.

## Goal


## How can I contribute?


## What if I have my own idea?
If you have an idea that isn't listed here, we would really like to hear about it. To pitch it, simply add a project to the list stating a title and providing a short description (see the examples of ongoing projects), and submit this as a **pull request**. If you'd like to provide further context and info, email Andre at andrefmsmith@gmail.com. Based on the info you provide us, we can give you feedback whether the idea is feasible within the constraints of our dataset.

The nice thing about submitting your project idea as a pull request is that **you** get public credit for your contribution!
