# Intro
Paired recording datasets are conceptually very simple but can be used to tackle and explore a variety of interesting questions. Here we propose and describe a list of analysis projects to be carried out on our two paired recording datasets (Marques-Smith et al., 2018; Neto et al., 2016). The Kampff lab will be actively contributing to these projects and they are open to anyone who's interested in taking part. We are crowdsourcing these projects because they are interesting but complex and time-consuming; we simply do not have the full range of expertise and man-power required to complete them in a useful time-frame. That's where **you** come in.

## Goal


## How can I contribute?


## What if I have my own idea?
If you have an idea that isn't listed here, we would really like to hear about it. To pitch it, simply add a project to the list stating a title and providing a short description (see the examples of ongoing projects), and submit this as a **pull request**. If you'd like to provide further context and info, email Andre at andrefmsmith@gmail.com. Based on the info you provide us, we can give you feedback whether the idea is feasible within the constraints of our dataset.

The nice thing about submitting your project idea as a pull request is that **you** get public credit for your contribution!


## Ongoing Projects

**1. Mapping synaptic connectivity using dense extracellular probes**
  - *One of the most exciting features of high channel-count/density probes is the drastic increase in number of potential pair-wise synaptic interactions between recorded units. One direction for this project is to focus on the 5 whole-cell recordings, detect EPSPs in them and try to match these to pre-synaptic spikes of units sorted from the accompanying Neuropixel recording. Another would be to simply use our Neuropixel recordings as a testing ground for algorithms attempting to infer synaptic connectivity from firing rates of sorted units. In the latter case, the benefit of the paired-recording dataset is that you can rely on the "ground-truth" neuron as being a genuine unit.*

**2. Exploring axon terminal and field post-synaptic potentials (AxTPs and fPSPs)**
  - *Axon terminals generate extracellular electrical fields, which can be detected by extracellular channels that are close enough to them. This is also true for field post-synaptic potentials - see [Swadlow & Gusev 2000](https://www.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/jn.2000.83.5.2802?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed), [Swadlow et al 2002](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/17/7766.long), [Hagen et al., 2017](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/37/20/5123.long) and [Shein-Idelson et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4393). However, these signals are far too small ( a few uV) to be detected on a single trial basis. Moreover, to be convincingly recognised as an AxTP, the signal must be far enough from the somatic compartment that it cannot simply be explained as distal detection of an attenuated somatic action potential. Our pair-recorded cells are units with known spike times and location in space. Moreover, Neuropixel probes have extremely high channel density, greatly increasing the likelihood that a channel happens to be located close to a recorded cell's axon terminal. This means in our dataset we can average thousands of spikes of a pair-recorded unit and search for AxTP signatures in channels that are far from the soma. Upon finding AxTPs in a channel, we can enquire if the firing rate of units in that channel was modulated by spiking of the AxTP's "owner" cell. The AxTP could thus potentially offer an added level of assurance for unit-to-unit synaptic connectivity, by providing a mechanistic, physiological substrate. Our dataset contains both putative pyramidal and interneuron pair-recorded units, meaning we can search for excitatory or inhibitory synaptic interactions. *
