| I'm interested in paradox, invention, and smart enthusiastic people. I'm good at physics, optics, microscopy, building, and coding. |
| I can contribute a solid technical and social commitment to re-inventing scientific publishing. My funding is stable and my employees are permanent, so I can tolerate an unusually high level of professional risk, for a scientist. I can be the guy who jumps first to see if the parachute opens. |
| I'm looking for a community of other potential jumpers for shop talk, tip-trading, and camaraderie. |
