We want to grow a critical mass of researchers that want to collaborate and share their science openly:

* Gathering researchers and groups in our local community who are using, or starting to use, open science workflows to share all scientific outputs
* Comparing individual experiences, tools, and skill-sets
* Document our process of collaboration and possible standards
* Increasing the accessibility of tools throughout the broader research community
